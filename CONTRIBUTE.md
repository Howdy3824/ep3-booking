# Contribute to ep-3 Bookingsystem

Contribution of code is very simple and (generally :relieved:) welcome.

Just send [GitHub pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) to suggest new features, fixes
or any other code changes and they will be gladly reviewed.

Keep in mind though, that such requests will not necessarily be accepted. In order to enable quick reviews, you should
keep your requests small and consise, describe them properly and follow the coding guidelines (see below).

## Coding Guidelines

The project generally follows the [PSR-4 coding standards](http://www.php-fig.org/), just like Zend Framework 2 does
(which the system is based on), so make sure to read them and apply them to your commits.

Regarding the architecture, this project is heavily based on ZF2 architecture and philosophy, so the ZF2 documentation
will also be a valuable source of information.

Since the system requires PHP 5.6+, everyone is encouraged to use all the new features that version has to offer.
