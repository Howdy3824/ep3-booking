# ep-3 Bookingsystem

The ep-3 Bookingsystem is an open source (MIT licensed) web application to enable users to check and book free places of
an arbitrary facility easily online via one huge calendar.

It was initially developed to enable booking free squares of a covered court for a tennis club, improved along some
versions, tried to offer commercially as a SaaS - and finally released as open source software.

Among its primary features are extensive customization capabilities (thus making it interesting even outside the tennis
branch), multilingualism (currently shipped with english and german), an interactive, easy-to-use calendar, an
easy-to-use and easy-to-understand backend, a consistent and clear visual design and a fully responsive layout (thus
looking nice on mobile devices as well).

More features may be explored via our website (http://bs.hbsys.de/) or simply by downloading and trying the system
yourself.

## Documentation and installation

Documentation and installation instructions can be found in the following directory:

```
data/docs/
```

## Architecture

The system is based on the well-known LAMP stack (Linux, Apache 2, MySQL 5+, PHP 5.6+) and the powerful
[Zend Framework 2](http://framework.zend.com/) (2.5).

It is compatible with PHP version up to and including 7.4. We are currently working on an upgrade of the underlying
Zend Framework to make it compatible with PHP 8.0.

Dependencies are managed with [composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

The source code is version controlled with [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/).
