# Update of the ep-3 Bookingsystem from an existing/older version

## 1. Backup

First and most importantly: Backup your database and entire project directory!


## 2. Clear cache

After every update you should delete all files within the

- `data/cache/`

directory.

If you haven't made any changes to the core files, your configuration, customizations and data should stay intact
after the update.


## Update from 1.8.0 to `1.8.1`

- Replace the `vendor/` directory


## Update from 1.7.0 to `1.8.0`

ðŸš¨ Warnings:

- This version is only compatible with **PHP 8.1** or higher
- Due to extensive code changes for this compatibility, there may appear new (and not yet "issued") bugs.  
  Please test this version thoroughly before deploying in production.  
  Also, please report any PHP 8.1 related bugs in our [GitHub issue section](https://github.com/tkrebs/ep3-bs/issues).
- The bundled *file manager* has been removed in this version, as it was outdated and considered insecure.  
  Until we have implemented a new solution, you may have to upload files the old-fashioned way ((S)FTP or similar).

Update steps:

- Replace the `data/docs/` directory
- Create a `data/mails` directory
- Replace the `module/` directory
  - If you made custom changes to the code, you have to migrate them manually 
- Replace files:
  - `public/index.php`
  - `public/setup.php`
- Delete the directory `public/vendor/filemanager`:  
  This is technically not necessary, but recommended. 
- Paste the new `src/` directory
- Replace the `vendor/` directory
- Technically not necessary, but for consistency reasons:  
  Replace the files in the project directory:
  - `composer.json` 
  - `composer.lock` 
  - `CONTRIBUTE.md` 
  - `INSTALL.md` 
  - `LICENSE` 
  - `README.md` 
  - `UPDATE.md` 
  - `VERSION`
  - Delete files:
    - `INSTALL` (without file extension)
    - `README` (without file extension)
