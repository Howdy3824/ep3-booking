--- Update to 1.4 / 1.5 ---

First backup your database and project directory!

Then replace the following directories and files with the new ones:

- /data/res/

- /module/

- /public/css/
- /public/docs/
- /public/imgs/
- /public/js/
- /public/misc/
- /public/vendor/
- index.php

- /vendor/ (alternatively, you may update dependencies via composer after replacing the composer.json)

- All single files in the project root directory

If you haven't made any changes to the core files, your configuration, customizations and data should stay intact
after the update. Otherwise, it's clearly your fault! :)



--- Updates in general ---

After every update you should delete all files within the

- /data/cache

directory.
