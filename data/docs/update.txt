--- Update to 1.4 ---

First backup your database and project directory!

Then replace the following directories and files with the new ones:

- /data/res/

- /module/

- /public/css/
- /public/docs/
- /public/imgs/
- /public/js/
- /public/misc/
- /public/vendor/
- index.php
- setup.php

- /vendor/

- All single files in the project root directory

If you haven't made any changes to the core files, your configuration, customizations and data should stay intact
after the update. Otherwise, it's clearly your fault! :)
